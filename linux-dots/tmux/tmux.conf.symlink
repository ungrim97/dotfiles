# First, lets make it like screen (eugh). Kinda dirty, but the ctrl-b binding is just dumb.
# It is too much of a contortion for something that is used that often

# This first part makes the two commands for splitting the window:
# ctrl-a | = split side by side
# ctrl-a - = split up and down
unbind %
bind | split-window -h -c '#{pane_current_path}'
bind - split-window -v -c '#{pane_current_path}'

# new-window is bound to c by default, this just makes it open at the current path.
bind c new-window -c '#{pane_current_path}'

# C-a C-a for last window, from screen
bind-key C-a last-window

# use the vim motion keys to move between panes

# swapping panes and windows also handled, but they form lists rather than real
# grids so vim keys not as great.

# Monitoring all activity is a bit much for things like irssi.
# Just want to monitor for bell, which can be controlled.

# tmux powerline configuration
# If you have problems with this then consult the /tmp/tmux.log file.
#
# If the problem is "protocol version mismatch" then the tmux server is running
# a different version than the client. This can happen when you have compiled
# your own version of tmux but the run-shell command uses the system tmux.
#
# The best way to fix this is to set the PATH appropriately.
# Remember that this command should be sh compatible so do not rely on ~ expansion.
